# Summary

The redundancy in the genetic code means that apart from methionine and tryptophan, an amino acid is encoded by at least two codons. Different codons for the same amino acid are termed synonymous codons. Synonymous codon usage is strongly influenced by evolutionary forces namely, selection and mutation and may vary strongly within or among organisms The preference of specific codons over others contributes to this variation and this phenomenon is called codon usage bias (CUB).

Many measurements have been developed to analysis and study CUB; effective number of codons ( ENc ) [@Wright1990], codon adaptation index ( CAI ), relative synonymous codon usage ( RSCU ) [@Sharp1987] and, translational selection index ( P2-index ) [@Wang2018]. Also, statistical analysis has been used to investigate the effect of different factors as selection and mutation on shaping CUB as; Correspondence analysis, Parity Rule 2-plot Analysis and, Neutrality Plot [@Song2017]. BCAW tool was developed to analyze such phenomena ( Codon Usage Bias ) by the aforementioned  measurements.

Various tools are available to analyze and measure CUB, but they lack some important measurements and plots for CUB analysis. What BCAWtool does is an automated workflow to study the CUB of any organism genes by all the measurements and plots mentioned above. Further, Using correlation method to determine the optimal codons described by [@Hershberg2009] is implemented for the first time in BCAW tool. The tool also includes statistical analysis as correspondence analysis, correlation analysis, and t-test.
 
# Implementation

BCAWtool was developed using python 3.7 with build in and third-party packages [@Lee2018]. The usage of BCAW Tool is made to be very easy where users have only to input a fasta format file containing genes to be analyzed, and a bunch of analysis will be performed.

```
from BCAWT import BCAWT
BCAWT.BCAW('Ecoli','result_folder',genetic_code_=11,fasta=True,Auto=True)
```

The expected outputs are 23 different files, 8 are in comma-separated values ( CSV ) format, 4 are in text format and, 11 graphs in portable network graphics ( PNG ) format. The equations used for analyzing CUB in the tool and the expected outputs, as well as the API are reported in the BCAWT's [documentation](https://bcaw-tools-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The advantages for BCAWtool over the existing tools are; 1- Automated Workflow,  2- No limitations on the number of genes, 3- The method used to determine optimal codons named correlation method is only available in the BCAW tool,  4- Plots as violin plots for nucleotides contents, and other plots are generated by the BCAWtool and no need for using another software to draw such plots.

# OutPut summary

Visualization is the best way to present data. Hence, BCAWtool returns CSV files contain the codon usage analysis and the codon usage bias indices output ( Table 1 ), after that, it returns 11 plot  (Fig 1), so one could interpret the results easily.
