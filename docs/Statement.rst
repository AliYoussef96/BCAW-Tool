Statement of Need
==================
There are no tools available enable users to run a whole automated workflow for codon usage bias analysis. 

BCAW Tool (Bio Codon Analysis Workflow Tool) was developed to address this problem. 

Expected results from BCAW are: nucleotide content, various codon usage measures (effective number of codons, codon adaptation index, *etc*.) as well as correlation analysis with graphs. In addition, correspondence analysis and determination of putative optimal codons are included. BCAW Tool manages a complete automated workflow to analyze the codon usage bias for the genes and genomes of any organism. BCAW Tool is available as executable application, works with the Windows operating system, and has its source code availible under the MIT License.
