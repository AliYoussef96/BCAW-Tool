Statement of Need
==================

There are no tools available enable users to run a whole automated workflow for codon usage bias analysis. Using python 3.7 BCAW Tool ( Bio Codon Analysis Workflow Tool ) was developed to address this problem. BCAW Tool manages a complete automated workflow to analyze the codon usage bias for genes and genomes of any organism. With minimum coding skills.
